# Student-dropout-prediction-project12
End-to-end project predicting student dropout risk using Python, EDA, machine learning, SHAP, and dashboards.
# ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Prediction Project

This project aims to identify students at risk of dropping out or underperforming based on academic, demographic, and behavioral data. Using supervised machine learning and statistical techniques, the model provides interpretable predictions that can help educators and institutions intervene early to improve outcomes.
